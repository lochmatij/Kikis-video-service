# Kikis-video-service
Simple Android video player developed specially for children

Default android video player was uncomfortable to use, so this app was created

My daughter loves to watch `Kiki's delivery service` anime, so it gave name for the app.

First Kotlin experience, so open for suggestions

Use local videos from system `Movies` directory for playback

Tested with `Poco 3Pro` phone
