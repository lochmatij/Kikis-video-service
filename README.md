# Kikis-video-service
Simple Android video player developed specially for children

Default android video player was uncomfortable to use, so this app was created. Main idea is to have simple player with minimal UI

My daughter loves to watch `Kiki's delivery service` anime, so it gave name for the app.

First Kotlin experience, so open for suggestions

Use local videos from system `Movies` directory for playback

Tested with `Poco 3Pro` phone and 18 month old QA specialist
